            <b>We are at the age of 19 
                <br>As of the time we met at that school, we realized this is all we have, us.
                <br> The reason why I made this doc and posted on the internet is
                <br> because we, the ouselves, are the memoir and reminiscine of our lives at the same time.
                <br> Is that really wrong to remember us?
                <br> If not, take a look at those.
