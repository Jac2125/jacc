            I will not speak ill of Jack Flick.<br>
            I will rarely look<br>
            at the scar he made on my cheek<br>
            one summer at the lake.<br><br>
    
            I won't speak ill of Jack whose freckles<br>
            and gangly legs are gone.<br>
            So is the drained face I saw when he saw<br>
            what he'd done with a sharp rock<br>
            nonchalantly skipped.<br><br>
    
            I will speak well, for it was somewhat<br>
            sweet to lie on the dock while Jack<br>
            and his friends bent down<br>
            and wiped my face with a sandy towel.<br>
            I will speak well of them,<br>
            for most are gone<br>
            and the wound proved small.<br><br>
    
            I will speak well, for the rock<br>
            missed my eye. I can hardly find<br>
            the scar. Jack went into the air<br>
            corps, fought in one of the wars,<br>
            retired, and lived less than a year<br>
            before his tender heart gave out.<br><br>
    
            I will speak well of Jack.

            Another Elegy ["This is what our dying looks like"]

            This is what our dying looks like.<br>
            You believe in the sun. I believe<br>
            I can't love you. Always be closing,<br>
            Said our favorite professor before<br>
            He let the gun go off in his mouth.<br>
            I turned 29 the way any man turns<br>
            In his sleep, unaware of the earth<br>
            Moving beneath him, its plates in<br>
            Their places, a dated disagreement.<br>
            Let's fight it out, baby. You have<br>
            Only so long left—a man turning<br>
            In his sleep—so I take a picture.<br>
            I won't look at it, of course. It's<br>
            His bad side, his Mr. Hyde, the hole<br>
            In a husband's head, the O<br>
            Of his wife's mouth. Every night,<br>
            I take a pill. Miss one, and I'm gone.<br>
            Miss two, and we're through. Hotels<br>
            Bore me, unless I get a mountain view,<br>
            A room in which my cell won't work,<br>
            And there's nothing to do but see<br>
            The sun go down into the ground<br>
            That cradles us as any coffin can.<br>

            The pain mine
            <br>Long enough for me
            <br>To lose the wound that invented it
            <br>As none of us knows the beauty
            <br>Of our own eyes
            <br>Until a man tells us they are
            <br>Why God made brown. Then
            <br>That same man says he lives to touch
            <br>The smoothest parts, suggesting our
            <br>Surface area can be understood
            <br>By degrees of satin. Him I will
            <br>Follow until I am as rough outside
            <br>as I am within. I cannot locate the origin
            <br>Of slaughter, but I know
            <br>How my own feels, that I live with it
            <br>And sometimes use it
            <br>To get the living done,
            <br>Because I am what gladiators call
            <br>A man in love—love
            <br>Being any reminder we survived.
